### Hello! 👋

I'm Joey. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile. Why "Rinchen"? It was my well-known IRC handle back in the day. By the time I considered changing it, all the related names on GitHub were already taken. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working in the Data Privacy, Information Security, & Governance, Risk, and Audit areas.
- 🤝 I’m collaborating on privacy topics at [W3C](https://github.com/w3c) as part of the Privacy Working Group.
- ♥ I love FOSS. I was fortunate to have worked for a GNU/Linux distro in the past. I personally use [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/), although I don't use it for gaming.
